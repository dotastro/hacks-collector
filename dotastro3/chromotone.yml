description: >
  Exploring multiwavelength astronomy with sound. Each waveband has a pitch, the intensity/brightness in that waveband is represented by volume/loudness of the note. When you scan a mouse of an image Chromotone plays a chord with different components which correspond to the intensity at each pixel superposed.
  The original version was written in Processing which is not particularly web friendly so this project aims to make a version which is lighter, more efficient and has added functionality.
