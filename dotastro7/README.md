We aim to host approximately 50 attendees for a three-ish-day event all about astronomy online – developing web tools to enhance research outputs, and research tools to make data-rich astronomy easier. The event will include a series of talks, multiple open unconference sessions, and a full day hacking on awesome, innovative projects.
